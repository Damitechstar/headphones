# Implement a Design from Scratch Project

Welcome to our amazing project! This README.md will guide you through the key interactions and design notes for our web page created using Figma.

## Interactions

Our web page has a responsive design that automatically switches to the mobile version when the screen width is 480px or less. This ensures a seamless user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Design Notes

### Colors

- Links Hover/Active: #FF6565
- Button Hover/Active: Opacity: 0.9

### Content Width

The maximum width of the content is set to 1000px, which is centered on the page. This ensures that the content remains readable and visually appealing on larger screens while maintaining a comfortable reading experience on smaller ones.
